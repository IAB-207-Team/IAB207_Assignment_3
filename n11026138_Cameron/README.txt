## Project Assumptions ##

1. There is no criteria for creating a user details page, though it is still logical to include under an account 
   drop down menu, this link at the moment takes you back to index.html.

2. No functionaility has been added to the create event page as this is assumed not to be a requirement (similar to booking event tickets, this is not stated as a requirement to implement functionaility)

3. All event links link to the same details page, according to the assessment criteria.
